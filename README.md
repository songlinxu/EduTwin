# Leveraging generative artificial intelligence to simulate student learning behavior

## Introduction

This is the code implementation for experiment running and figure drawing in the paper: "Leveraging generative artificial intelligence to simulate student learning behavior".


## Instruction
Note: Prepare your own openAI API key if you want to run the study.


### Experiment 1

- Run study: use code run_study1.py in folder "study1". (You need to add your OpenAI API Key in the code)
- Draw result figures in the paper: use code figure.py in folder "study1".

### Experiment 2

- Run study: use code run_study2.py in folder "study2". (You need to add your OpenAI API Key in the code)
- Draw result figures in the paper: use code figure.py and map.py in folder "study2".

### Experiment 3

- Run study: use code run_study3.py in folder "study3". (You need to add your OpenAI API Key in the code)
- Draw result figures in the paper: use code figure.py and sankey_figure.py in folder "study3".

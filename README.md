# Exploring Human-AI alignment in dynamics of student behaviors and learning success

## Introduction

This is the code implementation for experiment running and figure drawing in the paper: "Exploring Human-AI alignment in dynamics of student behaviors and learning success".


## Instruction
Note: Prepare your own openAI API key if you want to run the study.


### Experiment 1

- Run study: use code run_study1.py in folder "study1". (You need to add your OpenAI API Key in line 667 in ./study1/utils.py)
- Draw result figures in the paper: use code figure.py in folder "study1".

### Experiment 2

- Run study: use code run_study2.py in folder "study2". (You need to add your OpenAI API Key in line 27 in ./study2/utils.py)
- Draw result figures in the paper: use code figure.py and map.py in folder "study2".

### Experiment 3,4,5

- Run study: use code run_study3.py in folder "study3". (You need to add your OpenAI API Key in line 13 in ./study3/utils.py)
- Draw result figures in the paper: use code figure.py in folder "study3".

### Experiment 6

- Run study: use code baseline_new.py in folder "study4". 
- Draw result figures in the paper: use code figure_paper.py in folder "study4".
